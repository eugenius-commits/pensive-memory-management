# Memory Management Module

The Memory Management Module is a Spring Boot application designed to provide functionalities for managing memories in a web application.

## Overview

The Memory Management Module offers the following features:

- **Memory CRUD Operations**: Allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on memories.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores memory data in a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA.
- **RESTful API**: Provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with memories, making it suitable for integration with frontend or other backend systems.
- **Exception Handling**: Includes exception handling mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, such as when a memory is not found.

## Usage

To use the Memory Management Module in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Database**: Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings in the `application.yaml` file.

3. **Build the Application**: Build the Spring Boot application using Maven or your preferred build tool.

4. **Run the Application**: Run the application, and it will automatically create the necessary database tables based on the entity models.

5. **Access the API**: Access the RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on memories. The endpoints are typically available at `http://localhost:8080/api/memories`.

## API Endpoints

The Memory Management Module exposes the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/memories**: Retrieve all memories.
- **GET /api/memories/{id}**: Retrieve a memory by ID.
- **POST /api/memories**: Create a new memory.
- **PUT /api/memories/{id}**: Update an existing memory.
- **DELETE /api/memories/{id}**: Delete a memory by ID.
